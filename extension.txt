---EXTENSION PART---

In the extension section, I added 4 functions, namely B-SUB, SIZE, ZEROS and RAND.

- White box test: I put the white box test at the end of extension.c file in the form of void test().
You can run the file by using the "make extension" instruction and test each function itself by running the extension.c file.

- Black box test: I also put some new .nlb files inside the extension folder.
The detailed introduction of each function and the corresponding answer towards each test by running "make extension", are as follows:


1. B-SUB
(This function is similar to B-ADD, subtracting each number in the array
from another number to get the result)


extension1.nlb

ARRAY:
7 7 7 7
7 7 7 7



Grammar: <BINARYOP> :: "B-AND" | "B-OR" | "B-GREATER" | "B-LESS" | "B-ADD" | "B-TIMES" | "B-EQUALS" | "B-SUB"
--------



2ï¼ŒZEROS
(Similar to ONES, the user specifies the value of the row and column, and can print a matrix of the same size where each cell value is 0)

extension2.nlb

ARRAY:
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0



Grammar: <CREATE> ::= "ONES" <ROWS> <COLS> <VARNAME> | "READ" <FILENAME> <VARNAME> | "ZEROS" <ROWS> <COLS>
---------



3. SIZE
(The size function is similar to PRINT, except that it prints the size value of the
specified variable and the total number of cells it contains)


extension3.nlb

ROW: 5  Col: 5  TOTAL CELLS: 25



Grammar:  <INSTRC> ::= <PRINT> | <SET> | <CREATE> | <LOOP> | <SIZE>
          <SIZE> ::= "SIZE" <VARNAME>
--------



4. RAND
((Similar to ONES, the user specifies the value of the row and column,
and can print a matrix of the same size where each cell value is a random number between 0-99.)

extension4.nlb

This test will generate a 5*5 matrix, and the value in each cell is a random number between 0-99.



Grammar: <CREATE> ::= "ONES" <ROWS> <COLS> <VARNAME> | "READ" <FILENAME> <VARNAME> | "ZEROS" <ROWS> <COLS> | "RAND" <ROWS> <COLS>
